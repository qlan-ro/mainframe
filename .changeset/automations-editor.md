Rebuild the automations editor around values you can name and reuse. Every text field in an automation now accepts `$name` references through the same picker, a Set value step names a result once so later steps can use it, and renaming that value rewrites every step that referred to it. Write `${name}` where a bare `$name` would run into surrounding text, as in `todo/${id}`.

Each step that produces a value carries its own name, so reordering steps no longer silently repoints a reference at a different step. Two values sharing a name is reported as a problem on both, rather than one quietly winning.

Webhook triggers can be registered from the editor, which now shows the signing secret alongside the URL — without it a registered hook rejected every delivery. The secret is shown on request and never leaves the editor; reveal it again any time, it does not change.

Problems are reported on the step that caused them, including the ones the daemon finds at save time, which used to appear only as a toast. A reference to a name nothing defines is a warning rather than an error, so a prompt containing `$HOME` no longer blocks saving.
