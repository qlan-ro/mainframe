# app-tauri Migration Tracker (desktop → Tauri)

**Living checklist.** Update the status marks as work lands. This is the index that prevents skipped surfaces across sessions / context resets. It folds in the 10-subsystem port analysis (otherwise only in a temp file).

**Status:** ☐ todo · ◐ in progress · ☑ done · ⊘ dropped (intentional, not ported)
**Disposition:** `port` = port-as-is · `refactor` = refactor-then-port · `replace` = replace-with-new-design · `drop`

**Companion docs (don't duplicate — update them, link here):**
- Target structure → `docs/architecture/2026-06-04-app-tauri-architecture.md`
- Risks/critique → `docs/architecture/2026-06-04-app-tauri-architecture-critique.md`
- Chat runtime decision (+ react-opencode) → `docs/architecture/2026-06-05-chat-runtime-decision.md`

## Where we are

- ☑ **C1 spike** — Tauri shell + Node daemon sidecar + login-shell env capture; agent spawn under bare env proven (`87dbac10`).
- ☑ **Runtime decision** — `useExternalStoreRuntime` + per-chat controller, modeled on `@assistant-ui/react-opencode` (ADR).
- ☑ **Chat seam Phase 1** — drift-free, no message cache; reconnect re-syncs (`de4a73d1`).
- ☑ **AI toolkit** — skills (tauri-v2/shadcn/assistant-ui/radix/rust-best-practices), agents (tauri-shell-engineer/renderer-porter/design-conformance), review-gate hook.
- ☑ **Chat seam Phase 2A** — controller/reducer + `handle-daemon-event` + projection + `extras` + refetch-on-gap; dead Phase-1 spine removed; drift/gap empirically verified (`98f43f5a`).
- ☑ **shadcn foundation + theme + `@assistant-ui@0.14.14` bump** — 18 primitives, warm-chrome tokens, restyled ToolFallback/ToolGroup, aligned assistant-ui set (`8e18e634`, `48cfefd5`).
- ☑ **Interactive gate cards + review-fix pass** (2026-06-06) — the 3 inline gate cards (build-order step 10) shipped + live-tested, then a thermo-nuclear + codex review pass: **judo-A** count-aware window-free reconcile (`0c7f987c`), **judo-B** server-authoritative composer config — no optimism (`538d769d`), **judo-C** response-only reply seam (`9a688642`), permission reply/resume reliability — verify-timer + connected-gated fallback + restore-stale guard (`770a6c0a`), daemon orphaned-`working` recovery (`0f8f7dfe`) + single-`UPDATE` + Zod route (`31adee85`), AskUserQuestion result-wording parser (`6bc77c21`). All tested + changesets. *(Still open from this review: ws-client `message.send` CLOSED-drop — see Critical below.)*
- ☑ **Sessions sidebar (build-order step 11) — BUILT + design-conformed** (2026-06-07). One global `useRemoteThreadListRuntime` + native `ThreadListItemPrimitive` rows rendered in OUR custom grouped/filtered sidebar (under `features/sessions/{runtime,sidebar,tags,new-thread,view-model,ws}/`). **TIME** grouping (Pinned / Today / Yesterday / Earlier) + a **Sort By** menu — *project is a FILTER, not a group* (collapsible `ProjectFilterPillBar` pills + a per-row colored project chip). A collapsible wrapping `TagFilterBar` (+N more, no horizontal scroll), tag management (`TagPopover` + a single `TagPopoverHost` at root, cascade-mirror, validate-tag-name), a `SessionContextMenu` (Pin / Rename / Archive / Copy / Tags), the `ArchiveWorktreeDialog` archive-confirm bridge, dense rows with hover actions/pin, a warm-glass panel, and a thin auto-hide scrollbar.
- ☑ **Boot auto-opens the most-recent session** (`56ddee9f`) — parity with desktop; the app lands on the newest session instead of an empty thread.
- ☑ **Draft-aware new-thread flow** (`3f85617f`) — picker skipped when a project pill is active; live adapter/model/permission/plan/effort/feature selectors render *before* first send; the chat is still created on first send only (D3 preserved — no empty sessions).
- ☑ **Window chrome + surface tab strips + design-conformance pass** (2026-06-08). **Window chrome:** native macOS traffic lights positioned via `tauri.conf.json` `trafficLightPosition {x:20,y:30}` — vertically centered on the Chat/Editor/Preview switcher (measured DOM center y=27); **floating panels** restored (`AppShell` `p-2 gap-2`, prototype 04-engine root padding+gap) so the sidebar/surface inset equally instead of sitting flush. **Surface headers:** `ChatHeader` + shared `SurfaceTabStrip` (Files/Run) + `SurfacePicker` empty-state, with reactive split buttons (`layoutCanSplit`/`splitSurface`); chat is the permanent floor (never closeable). **Bottom `AppStatusBar`** (connection dot + daemon status, transparent — blends with the app bg). **Design glyphs** ported from the prototype (`surface-icons.tsx`: Chat/Editor/Preview + Tasks/Gear/SidebarLeft) replacing lucide lookalikes. **CSS cascade fix:** the `* { border-color }` reset was unlayered (beat every Tailwind border utility → active-row blue bar rendered gray, inactive rows showed a gray bar); moved into `@layer base`. **Composer height fix:** `ChatSurface` ChatHeader→ChatThread wrapper made a `min-h-0` flex column so `h-full` resolves (sticky composer stopped collapsing). Commits `cbb3f4ab`, `e76ac3c5`, `0cc612ca` (+ the surface-strip/status-bar commits).
- ☑ **Tauri MCP bridge (dev tooling)** (`cbb3f4ab`) — `tauri-plugin-mcp-bridge` registered under `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` (compiled out of release) + `withGlobalTauri` + `mcp-bridge:default` capability, so the Tauri MCP server can drive/inspect the webview (used to measure the traffic-light/switcher alignment). ✅ **`withGlobalTauri` release gating RESOLVED (2026-06-08):** the base `tauri.conf.json` now sets `withGlobalTauri: false` (release ships no `window.__TAURI__`); a dev-only overlay `src-tauri/tauri.dev.conf.json` re-enables it, merged via `--config` in the `tauri:dev` script (`pnpm tauri:dev`, **not** bare `cargo tauri dev` — the bare command no longer enables the bridge). A guard test (`src/__tests__/tauri-config.test.ts`) locks the release-safe default. `.mainframe` "App Tauri Preview" launch config added (vite dev on 5174, browser-mode daemon via `VITE_DAEMON_PORT`).
- ☑ **Browser-mode e2e harness for app-tauri** (2026-06-09). Playwright **Chromium against `vite preview`** (tauri-driver is Linux/Windows-only): `packages/e2e` gained a UI-agnostic daemon fixture (`fixtures/daemon.ts`, extracted from the Electron `app.ts`, `c50c7eeb`), an app-tauri fixture (`fixtures/app-tauri.ts` — builds with `VITE_DAEMON_PORT=31416` baked in, serves `vite preview`, launches Chromium, waits for Daemon Connected; `80df3bf2`), a `tauri` Playwright project split from `electron` (`0843c660`), and a helper layer (`helpers/tauri/` — testids, page objects, REST seed setup, wait; `83bf59a1`). **Three spec files ported** from the Electron suite: `composer.spec.ts` (11 pass/1 skip), `chat.spec.ts` (8 pass/3 skip), `sessions.spec.ts` (9 pass). Enablers: daemon health-poll moved to 127.0.0.1 (`eaaa1064` — daemon is IPv4-only, vite/localhost resolves ::1) + `data-chat-id` on session rows (`33a60357`).
- ☑ **Main-area header redesign** (2026-06-09) — `MainToolbar` (project/branch + theme toggle + gated stubs) mounted in `AppShell`, `ChatCardHeader` extracted from `ChatHeader`, `useTheme` store + root `ThemeEffect` (`.dark` toggle), `branchName` projection; spec + codex plan-review in `docs/plans`. Commits `462364f6`, `18fe3092`, `adf23b84`, `c9639392`, `75c7815e`. Whole-row session select trigger (`e3df28ae`); PR links + gated Review button in the chat-card header (`5e5338b9`).
- ☑ **Composer: unified provider+model picker** (2026-06-09, `f5d8251a`) — `ProviderModelSelect` replaces the separate `AdapterSelect` + `ModelSelect` (both deleted): one trigger (provider dot + model + chevron) opening a popover with a provider segmented row (locked by `installed`/`locked`) + a model list (stacked label/description, default marker). Still server-authoritative via `PATCH /config`. 15 unit tests; e2e M4 repointed (`a6c81465`).
- ☑ **Select-to-quote** (2026-06-09, `8129d976`) — native assistant-ui Quote: `SelectionToolbar`/`ComposerQuotePreview`/`QuoteBlock` hand-ported from the shadcn registry (NO `shadcn add` — lockfile/mobile trap) into `components/ui/assistant-ui/quote.tsx`; daemon glue = `parseSendInput` prepends the quote as a markdown blockquote (AI-SDK `injectQuoteContext` is inert under external-store).
- ☑ **Chrome text-selection disabled** (2026-06-09, `9b6f9001`) — `body { user-select: none }` with re-enable on content (`.aui-md`, inputs, editable, pre/code), mirroring desktop's app-shell rule.
- ☑ **Core fixes from e2e runs** (2026-06-09): `PATCH /tuning` now broadcasts `chat.updated` (`e77c311c` — effort/feature changes never reflected in server-authoritative clients); session-list reloads coalesced with a leading-edge 200ms debounce (`4ffdc6cc` — `chat.updated` bursts caused an O(events) refetch storm + a nav-race that yanked the active thread).
- ☑ **Sessions polish batch** (2026-06-10): remove-project via pill right-click context menu (`ProjectPillContextMenu`, `2c08d8ea`); tag popover anchored to its trigger (`f6b571a0` — root-mounted host had no Radix anchor → rendered off-screen at (0,0)); archived-active fallback now picks the most-recently-used session, respecting the project filter (`a2fadc42` — desktop parity via `pickInitialSession`).

## Review follow-ups — DEFERRED (from the 2026-06-05 thermo-nuclear + architecture + codex reviews)

> **Status (2026-06-07):** every Critical / High / Medium / Low item below is **RESOLVED**. The only thread still open from this review is the **retry-resend wiring** for failed user sends (minor follow-up — `UserMessage.tsx:228-229` + controller). It's carried into the Consolidated Backlog at the bottom.

Durable capture so these aren't lost (the full write-ups live in volatile `/tmp` handoffs: `handoff-architecture-review.md`, `handoff-features-chat-restructure.md`, `handoff-permissions-ask-plan-cards.md`). **Sequence: type/contract fixes → silent-failure UX → tests → restructure LAST (mechanical, moves-only).** Don't collapse the controller/reducer/projection spine — it's praised as clean.

**🔴 Critical**
- ☑ **ws-client drops frames silently** — RESOLVED (2026-06-06). Permission-hang half via the 3s verify-timer + connected-gated ack-fallback + restore-stale guard (`770a6c0a`); and `send()` now **buffers on any non-OPEN state** and kicks a reconnect (flushed on `onopen`) instead of dropping a `message.send`/`permission.respond` (H2, `7181e058`). *(codex #2 + arch.)*

**🟠 High**
- ☑ **`noUncheckedIndexedAccess` ON** — set in `app-tauri/tsconfig.json` (**0 new errors** — the code was already index-safe) + a `vitest.config.ts` coverage floor (none before) (H1, `5fd7733d`).
- ☑ **Optimistic send-failure is now visible** — `MainframeMessageMeta` declares `pending`/`clientId`/`error` (project-messages already wrote them); `UserMessage` renders a "Failed to send" indicator so a failed send no longer looks sent (H5, `841effe2`). *(retry-resend still needs controller wiring — minor follow-up.)*
- ☑ **Daemon boundaries validated** — `ws-client.onmessage` drops malformed frames (object + string `type` guard; deliberately NOT re-declaring the `DaemonEvent` union); `convert-message` uses `coerceUserMeta` (type-checked extraction) instead of a blind cast (H4, `7181e058`). *(codex #6 + arch.)*
- ☑ **Daemon `error` events surface** — `handle-daemon-event` maps `{type:'error'}` → `run.failed` (global or this-chat; other chats ignored) (H3, `f46fecb6`). *(codex #7.)*
- ☑ **Unsound message casts removed** — the 3 `as unknown as {message}` reads were unnecessary (typed via the ScopeRegistry); replaced with direct `useAuiState` selectors (H6, `841effe2`).
- ☑ **`features/chat/` directory restructure** — DONE (2026-06-06). Reframed after review: the code had already *improved* on the 06-04 proposal (the `runtime/` placeholder became `controller/`+`runtime/`+`view-model/`; the proposal's `cards/` became `gates/`), so the real drift was doc-vs-code. Landed: `tool-dispatch`→`tools/`, `tool-group-summary`→`view-model/`, `composer/`→`config-toolbar/`+`edit/`, a `features/chat/README.md` charter, and architecture.md's tree updated to the realized structure. **Intentionally dropped:** the `cards/`-by-family split — 15 flat card files are fine and families don't match the flat registry lookup. Moves-only, 455 tests green.

**🟡 Medium**
- ☑ Failed **history load renders as an empty chat** — DONE (2026-06-06). `extras.retry` (= `controller.refresh()`) + a "Couldn't load this chat / Retry" banner in `ChatThread` that reads `state.loadState.type === 'error'`. Tests cover load-fail → error → retry → ready.
- ☑ **`useConnectionState.init()` has no try/catch** — DONE (2026-06-06). Port acquisition is guarded → `disconnected`/`unavailable` + a 2s retry (sidecar may still be spawning); status-listener registration is separate. No longer pins on "connecting". Tested.
- ☑ **`isResultError` duplicated across 3 pill cards** — DONE (2026-06-06). Type-safe `isErrorResult`/`extractResultContent` extracted to `tools/shared/result.ts` (barrel-exported); Worktree/Schedule/MCP cards import them.
- ☑ **cancel_failed UI surfacing** — DONE (2026-06-06). **Toast infra added** (sonner `<Toaster />` themed + mounted at the app root, `components/ui/sonner.tsx`); `routeDaemonEvent` raises `toast.error` on `message.queued.cancel_failed`. *(This also unblocks the deferred composer rejection-toaster.)*

**🟢 Low**
- ☑ **CLAUDE.md drift** — the `composer.setRunConfig` note is corrected (config flows via REST + is server-authoritative, judo-B) and the count-aware reconcile + response-only reply seam are documented (`3391a256`). *(The `chat/README.md` charter is still a nice-to-have — folded into the restructure item above.)*
- ☑ **`TaskProgressCard` imports from the core sidecar** — DONE (2026-06-06). `TaskProgressItem` exported from `view-model/message-meta.ts` (identical shape) + imported locally; **zero `@qlan-ro/mainframe-core` imports remain** in `app-tauri/src`.

**✅ Already handled this session (not deferred):** codex #3 (subscribe-ack), #4 (queued snapshot rehydration), #5 (attachment reconcile) — fixed (`4b70efe1`) + tested + codex-APPROVED. codex #1 (gates not mounted) — the **parallel gates session** mounted inline gate dispatch (`35054382`). The thermo-nuclear batch (crash fix, `request<T>`, controller seam, dead-code, fullBytes de-casts, typed factory) — landed + tested. **Sandbox captures in the user message** — see the dedicated deferred line under *Composer* below.

## Parity gaps — desktop→app-tauri audit (2026-06-06)

A 5-area parallel sweep (messages · composer · tools · gates · runtime/parts) comparing the desktop chat surface against the app-tauri port. **Runtime/data + tool cards came back clean-or-better; most absences are the tracker-deferred items above (each verified by its tracker quote).** Below are the **UNTRACKED** gaps it surfaced — logged so they aren't silently "missed". They cluster in the composer; the data/runtime spine is solid.

> **Status (2026-06-07):** every parity gap listed here is **RESOLVED** except the standing deferrals — the multi-image gallery lightbox (prev/next nav; single-image zoom IS restored via `ZoomableImage`) and the intentional read-more 4-vs-6-line divergence (kept at 4). Both are carried into the Consolidated Backlog below.

**🔴 Silent failures (no user signal — fix first)**
- ☑ **`worktreeMissing` guard gone (composer)** — desktop disables input + send and shows a "worktree was deleted" banner (`desktop ComposerCard.tsx:355-363,392,477`); app-tauri `composer/Composer.tsx` never reads `worktreeMissing`. **DONE** — `Composer.tsx` reads `chatConfig.worktreeMissing`, disables Input + Send + the attachment dropzone, and renders a `chat-composer-worktree-missing` banner (with `worktreePath`). Tested in `composer/__tests__/Composer.test.tsx`.
- ☑ **Attachment rejection unsurfaced (composer)** — the adapter still throws on >5MB (`composer/attachment-adapter.ts`) but nothing renders it; desktop showed an inline error band (`ComposerCard.tsx:341-354`). **DONE** — the native composer swallows a rejected `add()` (dropzone `console.error`s; button path doesn't catch), so `attachment-adapter.add()` now fires `toast.error` (M1 toaster) before re-throwing. Tested in `composer/__tests__/attachment-adapter.test.ts`.

**🟠 Lost controls / features (untracked)**
- ☑ **Adapter (agent) selector dropped (composer toolbar)** — desktop has a Claude/Gemini/Codex/OpenCode dropdown disabled once the chat has messages (`ComposerCard.tsx:413-420`); app-tauri had none. **DONE** — new `config-toolbar/AdapterSelect.tsx` (shadcn DropdownMenu, mirrors ModelSelect), `useComposerTuning` gained `setAdapter` → PATCH `/config { adapterId }`, mounted leftmost in `ComposerToolbar` and `locked` once `thread.messages.length > 0`. Renders nothing with ≤1 adapter. Tested in `AdapterSelect.test.tsx` + `use-composer-tuning.test.ts`. *(Superseded 2026-06-09: `AdapterSelect` + `ModelSelect` merged into the unified `ProviderModelSelect`, `f5d8251a`.)*
- ☑ **`/`-skills context picker (+ `@`-file picker) — DONE (2026-06-06).** Built on the **native `Unstable_TriggerPopover`** (design `docs/architecture/2026-06-06-composer-trigger-pickers-design.md`; plan `docs/plans/…-plan.md`). New `lib/api/{projects,skills,files}.ts`, per-chat `features/skills/SkillsProvider` + `useChatSkills`, and `features/chat/composer/triggers/` (skills + file adapters, literal directive formatter, `ComposerTriggers` wiring) mounted in `Composer.tsx`/`ChatThread.tsx`. `/` inserts `/skill `, `@` fuzzy-searches project files (by `chat.projectId`) and inserts `@relpath ` (insert-only, no `POST /mentions`). Placeholder restored. The out-of-band SkillsPanel injection (`pendingInvocation`) stays out of scope (no such surface in app-tauri). Reverses the prior shadcn-`Command` plan — recorded in CLAUDE.md + the inventory.
- ☑ **In-message image click-to-zoom lost** — desktop opens a lightbox on user/assistant thumbs; app-tauri rendered inert `<img>`. **DONE (single-image zoom)** — new `parts/ZoomableImage.tsx` (shadcn `Dialog`, no new dep) restores click-to-zoom; wired into UserMessage `InlineImageThumbs` + AssistantMessage's `image` part. Tested in `parts/__tests__/ZoomableImage.test.tsx`. NOTE: the desktop **multi-image gallery nav** (prev/next) remains a separate keep-ours lightbox (inventory line 60) — not restored here; single-image zoom is the recovered affordance.
- ☑ **Plan "Reject" button removed** — desktop offers Reject (deny, no message) + Revise (deny + feedback) + Approve (`PlanApprovalCard.tsx:196-210`). **DONE** — added a third `chat-plan-reject` button (bare deny) alongside Approve & "Keep planning" (revise); `buildPlanResponse` gained a `{ kind: 'reject' }` → `{ behavior: 'deny' }` (no message). Tested in PlanGate.test.tsx + build-control-response.test.ts.

**⚪ Needs a live check**
- ☑ **Enter-to-send-while-running (queue)** — desktop intercepts Enter mid-run to enqueue (`ComposerCard.tsx:396-406`); app-tauri relied on native `ComposerPrimitive.Send`. **CONFIRMED GAP + FIXED.** Source check (`@assistant-ui/react@0.14.14` `ComposerInput.js`/`ExternalThread.js`): native Enter mid-run is `if (isRunning && !hasQueue) return;` where `hasQueue = !!queue` (the native `ExternalThreadQueueAdapter`). We pass **no** queue adapter (by design — daemon-backed queue, not the native local Queue), so `capabilities.queue=false` and Enter no-op'd mid-run; combined with our Send→Cancel swap, the keyboard path to enqueue was lost. **Fix:** `Composer.tsx` adds an `onKeyDown` that intercepts mid-run Enter and calls `aui.composer().send()` directly (its `canSend` ignores `isRunning`; with no queue adapter it routes through `onNew` → `controller.sendMessage` → daemon enqueues). Mirrors desktop. Tested in `composer/__tests__/Composer.test.tsx`.

**🟡 Minor / latent**
- ☑ AskUserQuestion **`header` title ignored** — app-tauri uses the raw question text + a static "Question" eyebrow (`gates/AskUserQuestionGate.tsx:144-145`); desktop titles with the model's `header` (`AskUserQuestionCard.tsx:75`). **DONE** — the gate now titles with `header ?? questions[0].header` (mirroring desktop's fallback) and drops the question text to a `chat-question-text` body line when a header is used.
- ☑ Markdown **link right-click context menu dropped** — desktop's `LinkWithPreview` had a Copy/Open context menu (`markdown-text.tsx:115-128,157`). **DONE** — added a shadcn `context-menu` primitive and wrapped the link (composed with the existing Tooltip via nested `asChild`) with Copy link / Open link items.
- ☑ **Skill id→display-name resolved — DONE (2026-06-06).** `UserMessage` now resolves the `/skill` chip via `resolveSkillName(metaCmd.name, useChatSkills().skills)` (a local copy of core's helper — app-tauri doesn't depend on the core sidecar). Raw-name fallback when skills haven't loaded. Done alongside the `/`-skills picker (same `SkillsProvider`).
- ☑ **`data-mf-composer-input` hook lost** — desktop tags the input so quote/find key off it (`ComposerCard.tsx:387`); app-tauri's input carries only `data-testid`. **DONE** — re-added `data-mf-composer-input` to the `Composer.tsx` Input.
- ☑ **MessageRenderBoundary not ported (resilience)** — desktop scopes assistant-ui `tapClientLookup` "Index out of bounds" crashes to ONE message. **DONE (ported as insurance).** The specific 0.14.14 race wasn't reproduced in a quick check, but the boundary is cheap and the failure mode (one throw kills the thread) is severe, so ported anyway: new `messages/MessageRenderBoundary.tsx` + `messages/bounded-messages.tsx` (`boundedMessageComponents`), wired into BOTH `ThreadPrimitive.Messages` mount points (ChatThread main thread + TaskCard subagent transcript). Tested in `messages/__tests__/MessageRenderBoundary.test.tsx`.
- ☑ Read-more clamp tightened 6→4 lines (`messages/ReadMoreBubble.tsx`) — cosmetic. **REVIEWED — kept at 4.** The 4-line clamp is intentional for the warm-chrome user card (the fade overlay `bottom-6 h-8` is tuned to it); desktop's 6 was not adopted. No artboard mandates 6, so not reverted.

## Chat Phase-2 build order (refined by the assistant-ui adoption research, 2026-06-05)
Do the chat leaves in this order; ☑ = done.
1. ☑ **shadcn foundation** — `components.json` + 18 `ui/` primitives + `globals.css` mapping shadcn vars → `--mf-*` (warm chrome, computed-CSS-verified); testid passthrough (`8e18e634`).
2. ◐ **assistant-ui shadcn group** — `ToolFallback` + `ToolGroup` restyled (`8e18e634`); `quote` + markdown + other shadcn components pending the inventory sweep.
2b. ☑ **bumped `@assistant-ui` → `react@0.14.14` / `core@0.2.10` / `store@0.2.13`** — set aligned (skew fixed), `groupPartByType`/`display:'standalone'` available (`48cfefd5`). Drift re-verify **PASSED** on 0.14.14 (no regression).
3. ☑ **runtime spine** — controller/reducer + `extras` (Phase 2A, `98f43f5a`).
4. ☑ **projection (go native)** — `convert-message` + `map-assistant-blocks` emit NATIVE parts: flat tool-calls (no `_ToolGroup`) + a `Task` tool-call carrying native `messages` (subagent transcript via `ExportedMessageRepository.fromArray`); `image` parts no longer skipped; `\0` sentinel/uniqueId/≥1-part preserved (the shared recursive mapper IS the WS14c invariant). **Verified:** payload sufficient, no daemon change. 13 unit tests green.
5. ☑ **groupBy + dispatch** — `MessagePrimitive.GroupedParts` + a **daemon-authoritative** `makeChatGroupBy` (reads `message.metadata.custom.mainframe.partGroups`, NOT a tool-name heuristic — see `2026-06-05-native-tool-rendering-seams.md`); standalone tools float, explore groups coalesce, reasoning collapses; `AssistantMessage`/`tool-dispatch` render leaves + the explore ToolGroup with a synthesized summary. **Both seams removed** (native card type + daemon membership).
6. ☑ **tool registry** — ONE registry (`Record<string, ToolCallMessagePartComponent>`, Fallback=`ToolFallback`), `resolveToolCard` for mcp__* prefix, `register-cards.ts` assembly (side-effect import in ChatThread, cycle-free); `makeAssistantToolUI` dropped. 14 per-family cards ported + restyled to warm-chrome (Edit/Write/Read/Search/Bash/Plan/Ask/MCP/Schedule/Worktree/Skill/Task/TaskProgress) + shared `tools/shared/*` infra + `ToolResultExpand` + diff-tint tokens. **Empirically verified** on `~/.mainframe_dev` (0 fallbacks). *Pending: design-conformance pass + remove SearchCard's dead structured-Grep branch (real Grep result is a plain string).*
7. ☑ **Task/subagent card** — native `ToolCallMessagePartComponent` reading `part.messages`, rendered via `ReadonlyThreadProvider` + `ThreadPrimitive.Messages` (reuses our message components so nested tools group). 13 Task cards rendered in the empirical check. *Pending: subagent `<usage>` stats — daemon doesn't surface them structurally (header omits them for now).*
8. ☑ **composer shell** — native `ComposerPrimitive.*` (Root/Input/Send/Cancel/AddAttachment/AttachmentDropzone/Attachments) restyled + Send↔Cancel swap on `thread.isRunning` + `ThreadPrimitive.ViewportFooter` (scroll-inset fix). Native `AttachmentAdapter` + shadcn attachment UI (thumb/preview/remove) + upload-on-send. Daemon-backed **queued messages** (pending cards + in-composer edit mode), NOT native `Queue` (`a660d84d`, `2059d69d`, `71f0a8ac`). Hardened by the controller-seam review fixes (`f5be810b`, `4b70efe1`). Verified live. *Deferred sub-features: `@`-mention picker, WorktreePopover (gated: git/worktree API), captures control (gated: sandbox surface), composer-drafts, rejection-toaster.*
9. ☑ **composer config toolbar** — model · permission · plan · effort · features as stateless shadcn controls, live `isRunning` disable. **Server-authoritative, NO optimism** (judo-B `538d769d`): the controller owns the config (seeds from REST on load, mirrors every `chat.updated` into `state.chatConfig`); `useComposerTuning` reads it live and a control just PATCHes — kills the optimistic-vs-broadcast flicker (`dbf70ba9`, `4d9b14a1`, `f5be810b`). **NOTE:** config flows via **REST** (`PATCH /chats/:id/config` + `/tuning`), NOT `setRunConfig.custom` — the daemon exposes those routes (**CLAUDE.md drift corrected this session**). `@`-mention picker (native `Unstable_TriggerPopover`) + worktree/captures controls deferred (see #8).
10. ☑ **permission/ask/plan cards** — DONE. 3 inline shadcn gate cards (`PermissionGate`/`AskUserQuestionGate` Back/Next wizard/`PlanGate` w/ exec-mode+clear-context) under `features/chat/gates/`, dispatched by `toolName` from `ChatGateMount` at the **thread tail** (decision: inline, NOT above-composer), reading queue-front via `useChatPermissionFront` (sorts `extras.permissions` by `askedAt`) + `replyToPermission`. Permission dismisses on answer; ask/plan persist via tool-result display cards. Hybrid: native inline parts + our extras reply (native `approval` gate IS usable under external-store but bypassed by choice — data is out-of-band). Plan: `docs/plans/2026-06-05-interactive-chat-gate-cards.md`. *(gates session)*
11. ☑ **sessions sidebar (hybrid) — BUILT + design-conformed** (2026-06-07). One global `useRemoteThreadListRuntime` (sessions + `custom` metadata via chats-REST adapter) + native `ThreadListItemPrimitive` rows (rename/archive/delete/select/active) rendered in OUR grouped/filtered/pinned layout. NOT flat `ThreadListPrimitive.Items`; NOT per-project runtimes. Realized in `features/sessions/{runtime,sidebar,tags,new-thread,view-model,ws}/`: **TIME** grouping (Pinned/Today/Yesterday/Earlier) + a **Sort By** menu (`SessionSidebar`); project is a **filter not a group** (`ProjectFilterPillBar` collapsible pills +N more + per-row colored chip); a collapsible wrapping `TagFilterBar` (+N more, no horizontal scroll); tag management (`TagPopover` + single `TagPopoverHost` at root, cascade-mirror, validate-tag-name); a `SessionContextMenu` (Pin/Rename/Archive/Copy/Tags); the `ArchiveWorktreeDialog` archive-confirm bridge; dense rows w/ hover actions/pin; warm-glass panel; thin auto-hide scrollbar. **Boot auto-opens the most-recent session** (`56ddee9f`) and the **new-thread flow is draft-aware** (`3f85617f` — picker skipped when a project pill is active, composer adapter/model/permission/plan/effort/feature selectors live before first send, chat created on first send only so no empty sessions).
   - **Deferred sidebar chrome** (logged so it's not lost — out of scope of the sessions list itself): the **surface rail** (Chat/Files/Run — gated on the Files/Run surfaces), the **bottom Context/Skills/Agents tabbed panel + resize handle**, **window chrome / traffic-lights + floating-panel-on-warm-gradient background** (needs the Tauri window-decorations decision), the ghosted/dashed **"Add project" pill** + the **add-project flow** (`ProjectFilterPillBar.tsx:10-11` — directory picker + project create/register), and the `SessionSidebar` **group-header "more" popover** (`SessionSidebar.tsx:53,71` — a presentational placeholder button w/ a testid but no popover wired). All folded into the Consolidated Backlog below.
12. ◐ **data-testid + stress validation — CLOSED WITH CAVEATS** (2026-06-08). **data-testid: DONE** — chat + sessions + layout audited; the only gaps (SurfaceTabStrip add, SurfacePicker rows) tagged (`fc6f3435`). **Stress matrix: ASSESSED, not re-run as one flow** (per decision — accept prior empirical verification): reconnect re-sync (`de4a73d1`), refetch-on-gap drift (`98f43f5a`), optimistic dedup judo-A (`0c7f987c`), mid-turn permission gates (step 10 live-tested), messages/tools (live on `~/.mainframe_dev`, 0 fallbacks) are each already verified. **Two open items carried forward as tracked gaps (below):** (a) the **two-windows** scenario is *not testable* — the shell is single-window, multi-window infra isn't built (see *Multi-window surface infrastructure*); (b) the **restored-permission "stream-closed"** known gap (daemon restart between Q and A) is unresolved (self-recovers on reload). A cohesive combined long-chat + nested-subagent + mid-turn-permission run remains the one un-exercised flow if a future regression is suspected.

## Cross-cutting foundation (underpins everything — build/maintain first)

- ☑ **shadcn `components/ui/` layer** — 18 primitives built + theme-wired to `--mf-*` (`8e18e634`).
- ☐ **Theming / tokens** (`refactor`) — `mainframe-theme.css` → Tailwind v4 `@theme`; 4 runtime-switchable themes; split Monaco/aui-md CSS out of `index.css`; token traps (no `/opacity` on CSS vars).
- ☑ **Typed-surface layout engine** (`replace`) — SurfaceHost + SurfaceRail + toggle model + floor invariant + intent-bus sub + Cmd/Ctrl+1/2/3 (replaces the whole `zone/` system). Per-session remembered layout deferred.
- ☑ **Login-shell env / sidecar spawn** (C1) — `src-tauri/shell_env.rs` + `sidecar.rs`.
- ☐ **Sidecar packaging** — bundle Node runtime (Tauri ships none) + native deps (`better-sqlite3`, `node-pty`, `@vscode/ripgrep`, `typescript-language-server`, `pyright`); per-platform binaries; signing/notarization. **Schedule-killer risk — spike before GA.**
- ☐ **Capabilities / CSP** (`replace`) — least-privilege per-command trust boundary (`src-tauri/capabilities/`). shell plugin already dropped.
- ◐ **e2e harness + data-testids** — **harness BUILT (2026-06-09, browser-mode Playwright — see Where-we-are)** with 3 spec files ported (composer/chat/sessions, 28 pass / 4 skip). Remaining: port the rest of the 130 Electron-bound specs as their surfaces land.
- ☑ **Tauri bridge** (`lib/tauri/`) — showItemInFolder, readFile, showNotification, log, getPlatform added. Updates/terminal/preview deferred.
- ☑ **Surface-intent bus** — emitSurfaceIntent/onSurfaceIntent in store/surface-intents.ts; chat-tool-context wired; features emit, layout subscribes.

## Port checklist by subsystem (from the 10-subsystem map)

### Shell & layout → `shell/` · `layout/` · `app/`
- ☐ `refactor` main.tsx · App.tsx + global keybinds · TitleBar · StatusBar (+useUpdateStatus/useConnectionState) · ConnectionOverlay/ErrorBoundary/Toaster
- ☐ `replace` TutorialOverlay · **entire `zone/` system + Layout + LeftRail/RightRail + store/layout.ts** · tool-windows.ts registry
- ☐ `drop` store/ui.ts
- ☐ `refactor` store/tabs.ts (center tabs/fileView/nav) · center/EditorTab/DiffTab/SkillEditorTab + panels/FileView* · panels/ChatsPanel+FlatSessionRow (god-files → decompose) · index.css

### Chat thread → `features/chat/{runtime,thread,tools,parts,find}`
- ☑ `refactor` convert-message.ts (projection) — *ported Phase 1, WS14c invariants preserved*
- ☑ `refactor` runtime provider → controller/reducer + `extras` + refetch-on-gap (Phase 2A, `98f43f5a`)
- ☑ `refactor` message components — `AssistantMessage` (GroupedParts dispatch + markdown + **native grouped reasoning** + action-bar/timing footer), `UserMessage` (cool card + directive-text chips + read-more + images), `SystemMessage` (compaction pill + **rich SkillLoadedCard**). Reasoning uses the canonical `group-reasoning` + `ReasoningRoot/Trigger/Content/Text` pattern (`defaultOpen={running}`). *(TurnFooter retired → MessageTiming; RenderBoundary deferred.)* **Empirically verified** on `~/.mainframe_dev`.
  - **Deferred User-Message states** (from `User Message States.html`, flagged so they're not lost): `UMCodeRef` (editor code-reference snippet card — *editor-integration leaf*); `UMInspectChip` (CSS-selector sandbox-inspect chips — *sandbox-capture leaf*); the PLAN "implementing plan" bubble (*permission/plan leaf*); file-attachment chips (*composer/attachments leaf*). Plain markdown code blocks a user *types* DO render via `markdownComponents`; `UMCodeRef` is a separate structured feature.
  - **Approved divergence:** `@mention` inline rendering uses the native `createDirectiveText` **Badge chip** (bg + border), not the artboard's plain accent-bold text — kept as an intentional upgrade (reviewed in the design-conformance pass). Don't re-flag.
  - **Design-conformance pass done** (vs `Chat Cards`/`User Message`/`Chat Markers` artboards): 2 blockers (silent `/opacity`-on-hex-`--destructive` → invisible error pills, fixed via `--mf-destructive-tint`), 8 majors + ~16 minors fixed. Reasoning "Thought for Ns" duration is gated on a daemon thinking-duration field (shows "Reasoning" until then).
- ☑ `refactor` tool cards (Edit/Write/Bash/Read/Search/Task/TaskGroup/ToolGroup/TaskProgress/MCP/Default/Plan/Skill/Worktree/Schedule + shared) — 14 families, warm-chrome, native registry.
- ☑ `replace` **unify the dual tool dispatcher** → one `tools.by_name`-style registry (`makeAssistantToolUI`/`renderToolCard` dropped); native `GroupedParts` for grouping + `part.messages` for subagents.
- ◐ `refactor` markdown stack — `markdown-text`(native `MarkdownTextPrimitive`)/`CodeHeader`/`syntax-highlight`(shiki)/`markdown-url-transform` ☑. FindBar+QuoteOnSelection (find leaf) · ToolResultExpand ☑ · message-parsing (inline mention highlight ported; full parser deferred).
- ◐ `port` small parts — `ReadMoreBubble` ☑ · `CompactionPill` ☑ · `SkillLoadedCard` ☑ (tool card) · native image parts ☑. SandboxCaptureContext/SelectorBreadcrumb/ImageThumbs-gallery/FileTypeIcon/ErrorPart deferred to their leaves.
- ☑ `drop` ThinkingPart.tsx — reasoning is native (shadcn `Reasoning`, collapsed).

> **Thread shell:** `ChatThread` + `App` restyled to warm-chrome (light), centered max-width column, native `ScrollToBottom`, `If running`→`useAuiState`, **CSS thin scrollbar** (radix ScrollArea doesn't bind to the autoscroll Viewport). Composer stays thin. Pending: `ViewportFooter` inset (real scroll-inset bug), welcome/suggestions.
> **Design-conformance:** chat cards + message shell PASSED (post-fixes) vs `Chat Cards`/`User Message`/`Chat Markers` artboards.

### Composer → `features/chat/composer/`
> Decompose the 485-line desktop `ComposerCard` — don't carry it. **Correction (2026-06-05):** the config toolbar was NOT gated — the daemon already serves every endpoint (desktop proves it); "missing from app-tauri" = wiring, not a missing surface. Only genuine **surfaces** (sandbox preview) are gated.
- ☑ **shell core** — `ComposerPrimitive` Root/Input/Send/Cancel restyle + running-swap · `ThreadPrimitive.ViewportFooter` (scroll-inset fix) · draft · send via `controller.sendMessage`. *(`a660d84d`)*
- ☑ **config toolbar (FULL)** — model · permission · plan · effort · features. Data layer: `lib/api/{adapters,chats}` (`getAdapters`/`getChat`/`setChatTuning` `PATCH /tuning` for effort+features / `setChatConfig` `PATCH /config` for model+plan+permission) + ported `lib/model-tuning`. Controls: `EffortPicker`/`FeaturesPopover`/`ModelSelect`/`PermissionSelect`/`PlanModeToggle` + `ComposerToolbar`, driven by `useComposerTuning` (each control a pure fn of the selected model's capabilities). **Verified live** (write loop persists). *(`dbf70ba9` + model/plan/permission)*
- ☑ **queued messages** — pending cool-cards at the thread tail (`QueuedUserTurn`, dashed `--mf-um-dash`, hover Edit/Cancel) + composer **edit mode** (`ComposerEditMode`, amber header, Save/Cancel-edit) via `composer-edit-context`; `editQueuedMessage`/`cancelQueuedMessage` REST. *(pending a live queued-message check — transient state.)*
- ☑ **attachments** — native `AttachmentAdapter` registered + upload-on-send (`attachmentIds`); **native shadcn `attachment` component** (thumb + preview Dialog + remove, non-deprecated `useAuiState`) + `ComposerAddAttachment` (paperclip) + `AttachmentDropzone`. Vendored `avatar` + `tooltip-icon-button`. **Verified live** (add → tile). Rejection-toaster deferred.
- ☐ **sandbox captures in the user message** — DEFERRED (with new designs, 2026-06-05). NOT actually gated: captures ride in the message as a `\0__MF_SANDBOX_CAPTURE__` sentinel + a `> **Preview captures**` block (+ image attachments); port desktop's `parseSandboxCaptureBlock` to strip it + render the context row (screenshot tiles + CSS-path inspect chips). Today the raw sentinel **leaks** as `MF_SANDBOX_CAPTURE` text in the bubble. (The capture-*creation* webview surface is separately gated.)
- ☐ **WorktreePopover** — needs worktree integration (verify whether it's REST-wireable like config before assuming gated).
- ☐ **mention/highlight:** `@`-mention picker = **native `Unstable_TriggerPopover` + custom `Unstable_TriggerAdapter`** (DECIDED 2026-06-05; sync adapter over async daemon path-search) + `ComposerHighlight` overlay.
- ☐ `replace` composer-drafts.ts (module Map → store)

### Editor & viewers → `features/editor/` (+lsp/) · `features/viewers/`
- ☐ `refactor` Monaco code+diff editors · setup.ts (workers/theme/opener) · viewers (image/svg/pdf/csv) · LSP client · copy-reference · inferLanguage/file-types
- ☐ `port` inline comments (useInlineComments/InlineCommentWidget)
- ☐ `replace` regex navigation.ts (LSP covers it) · nav-state singletons (editor-state/diff-nav → store)
- ☐ `drop` LineCommentPopover

### Terminal → `surfaces/run/terminal/` + `src-tauri/terminal.rs`
- ☐ `replace` **PTY backend → Rust PTY** (was Electron node-pty + IPC)
- ☐ `refactor` TerminalInstance (xterm) · TerminalPanel (tabs)
- ☐ `port` terminal-cwd.ts · useTerminalStore
- ☐ `drop` tool-windows terminal registration

### Settings → `features/settings/`
- ☐ `replace` SettingsModal shell (chrome/sidebar/routing on shadcn Dialog)
- ☐ `refactor` settings store · Provider(+TuningDefaults/CodexTuning/ModelDropdown) · General/Notifications/About/Sidebar · RemoteAccess (tunnel/pairing/devices — decompose the 697-line god-file)
- ☐ `port` settings-api + remote-access-api
- ☐ `drop` Keybindings placeholder pane

### Modals / palettes / pickers → `components/overlays/` · `features/review/`
- ☐ `replace` SearchPalette (+search store) → shadcn Command
- ☐ `refactor` FindInPathModal · DirectoryPickerModal · ReviewPanel(+Header/DiffView/FileTree)
- ☐ `drop` FullviewModal

### Tasks / Git / Tags / Sandbox(Run) → `features/{tasks,git,tags,run}`
- ☐ `replace` Sandbox PreviewTab → **embedded Tauri webview** (inspect/capture/console)
- ☐ `refactor` sandbox capture overlays + LaunchPopover/StopPopover + launch plumbing · Tasks/Todos panels (TodosPanel/TodoModal/QuickAdd/FilterBar/Card/Attachments/DependencyPicker) + todos-api · Git (BranchPopover/List/Submenu/NewBranch/Conflict/Rename + useBranchActions) · Tags (Popover/Pill/store/api)
- ☐ `port` capture-to-chat send path

### State & data layer → `lib/daemon/` · `lib/api/` · `lib/tauri/` · `stores/` · `hooks/`
- ◐ `refactor` WS client + useConnectionState · ws-event-router · HTTP api/ — *partially in Phase 1*
- ☐ `refactor` chats store + chat-actions + useChatSession + useActiveProjectId (chat state → controller per ADR) · LSP client
- ☐ `port` domain stores (projects/adapters/settings/skills/tags/sandbox/terminal/background-tasks/theme/toasts/search/find-in-chat/tutorial/todos-filters) · pure helpers (adapters/launch/format-*/file-types/utils/markdown-url-transform/parse-at-token)
- ☐ `replace` tabs store · plugins-layout store · logger/notify/useUpdateStatus/global.d.ts (→ `lib/tauri`)
- ☐ `drop` layout/ui stores (zones/panels)

### UI primitives & plugins → `components/ui/` · `features/plugins/`
- ☐ `replace` Radix-wrapper primitives (button/tooltip/scroll-area) · context-menu · toggle · **the missing primitives (Dialog/Select/Dropdown/Popover/Command/Checkbox/Label)** → shadcn
- ☐ `refactor` PluginView/PluginIcon/PluginError/PluginGlobalComponents (re-platform Electron `<webview>` → Tauri) · plugins store
- ☐ `port` scroll-row/truncated-label (bespoke) · plugins-api · usePluginShortcuts · utils.cn()
- ☐ `drop` input.tsx · tabs.tsx · zone plugin bridge

---

## Open decisions (resolve as we hit them)
- ☐ **Shared pure-logic package** — where `convertMessage` + diff math + file-types live so desktop & app-tauri share one copy (extend `@qlan-ro/mainframe-types` vs new `@qlan-ro/mainframe-shared`). Currently app-tauri-local.
- ☑ **Sessions list** — hybrid: one global `useRemoteThreadListRuntime` + native `ThreadListItemPrimitive` rows in our grouped sidebar (build-order step 11).
- ☑ **Drift handling** — refetch-on-gap, no daemon `seq` (decided).
- ☑ **Tool cards / permissions / composer = assistant-ui** — adoption verdicts locked (2026-06-05): tool cards + composer are native-restyle MATCHES; permissions have no native UI → custom shadcn cards via `extras`. See `app-tauri/CLAUDE.md` golden-rule pointers + the build order below.
- ☐ **Permission card mount placement** — currently **inline at the thread tail** (the realized default, build-order step 10 `35054382`) vs inline-under-tool. Inline-under-tool needs the daemon `control_request` to carry the originating `tool_use` id. *Default: inline-at-tail; revisit if the daemon carries the id.*
- ☑ **Part model = go native** — `GroupedParts`/`groupPartByType`/`display:'standalone'` + `part.messages` for subagents. **Preferred: do it in `convert-message`** (project the daemon's existing nested encoding → native parts); no daemon/contract change if the payload suffices, daemon flat-parts is the fallback (verify at build).
- ☑ **Sessions list = hybrid** — one global `useRemoteThreadListRuntime` (domain data in thread `custom`) + native `ThreadListItemPrimitive` rows rendered in OUR grouped/filtered sidebar layout (not flat `Items`, not per-project runtimes).
- ☑ **Reasoning = native, collapsed** — adopt native `Reasoning`, drop the dead `ThinkingPart`.
- ☑ **Queued banner = keep daemon-backed** `QueuedMessageBanner` (native `Queue` is a different local model). **Message errors = keep text-part routing. Quote = native UI + unavoidable CLI serialization glue.**
- ☐ **Phase-2 Rust daemon go/no-go + sizing** — biggest unscoped workstream; decide before committing.
- ☐ **Electron app lifecycle** — retire vs coexist (port 31415 / data-dir / prefs-origin); parity definition-of-done.
- ☐ **Mobile-contract governance** — the WS/REST contract is co-owned; changes stay additive.

## Deferred & Next-steps backlog (consolidated, 2026-06-07)

The single source of truth for what's left. Folds in items previously living only in code comments / memory / handoffs. Sizes: **S** ≤½ day · **M** 1–3 days · **L** ~1 week · **XL** multi-week / multiple sub-leaves. Status reflects the current built state (chat + sessions surfaces complete; everything else to port).

### Recommended next steps (ordered)
1. ✅ **DONE (`12f39eee`) — Declared `zustand` as an explicit dependency** in `packages/app-tauri/package.json` + the lockfile importer edge (hand-edited, no full re-resolve, per the mobile-submodule lockfile trap). *Was a phantom dep via shamefully-hoist; merge-blocker now cleared.*
2. ✅ **DONE (2026-06-08) — Sessions-sidebar loose ends + data-testid saturation.** The group-header "more" popover was already built+tested (tracker was stale, corrected `1586fc67`); the data-testid audit found only 2 gaps, now tagged (`fc6f3435`). Chat + sessions surfaces are true-done.
3. ◐ **ADR stress matrix (build-order step 12) — CLOSED WITH CAVEATS (2026-06-08).** Accepted prior per-scenario empirical verification (reconnect `de4a73d1`, drift `98f43f5a`, dedup `0c7f987c`, gates step 10, messages/tools live) rather than a fresh combined run. **Two carried-forward gaps:** two-windows is *not testable* (single-window shell — multi-window infra unbuilt) and the **restored-permission stream-closed** bug is unresolved. Revisit with a combined long-chat/subagent/mid-turn-permission flow only if a regression is suspected.
4. **Build the Tauri bridge** (`lib/tauri/` + `src-tauri/commands/`) — reveal-in-dir, open-external, app-info, updater, readFile, notifications, log, `window.confirm`→AlertDialog, drag-region. *Foundational: every non-chat surface (editor, run, settings, plugins) depends on the `window.mainframe.*` replacements.*
5. **Stand up the typed-surface layout engine** (SurfaceHost + SurfaceRail + by-arrival + per-session layout) **and the surface-intent bus**, then mount the surface rail (Chat/Files/Run). *Replaces the dropped `zone/` system; prerequisite for the Files/Run surfaces and wiring the chat tool-card `openFile`/`revealFile` intents (log-only today). The intent bus must land with it (lint-enforced `features/** ↛ layout/**`).*
6. **Port the editor surface** (Monaco code+diff + `setup.ts` + viewers + LSP client), then flip `chat-tool-context` `openFile`/`revealFile` from log-only to real intents. *Highest-value next surface; removes a chat-side stub. Re-solve the Monaco-in-Tauri loader story early.*
7. **De-risk packaging early** — spike the **sidecar bundling** (Node runtime + `better-sqlite3`/`node-pty`/ripgrep/LSP servers, per-platform binaries, signing/notarization) and establish **capabilities/CSP**. *Flagged as a schedule-killer; spike now in parallel to avoid a late GA blocker.*
8. **Resolve the standing open decisions in dependency order** — shared pure-logic package home (unblocks `convertMessage`/`model-tuning` dedup) → Phase-2 Rust-daemon go/no-go → Electron retire-vs-coexist + mobile-contract governance. *These gate cross-package structure and the terminal/sidecar architecture.*
9. **Build the remaining standalone surfaces in parity order** — Run/terminal (Rust PTY + xterm) → Settings (modal shell + panes + RemoteAccess decompose) → overlays (SearchPalette→Command, FindInPath/DirectoryPicker/Review) → Tasks/Git → Sandbox preview → Plugins UI. *Independent leaves once bridge + layout + intent bus exist; terminal first (heaviest Rust dep), plugins last (largest god-file + webview re-platform).*
10. **Complete the cross-cutting foundation last** — theming refactor (Tailwind v4 `@theme` + 4 themes + CSS split once Monaco lands), domain-store/pure-helper port, remaining shadcn primitive swaps, and grow the **e2e harness** (built 2026-06-09 — browser-mode Playwright; 3 specs ported) to cover new surfaces as they land. *Pervasive but lower-risk; the theme CSS split is partly blocked on Monaco.*

### Backlog by category

**Infrastructure / build**
- ☑ **S — Declare `zustand` as a real dependency** — DONE (`12f39eee`). Added `zustand: ^5.0.14` to `packages/app-tauri/package.json` + the lockfile importer edge by hand (no full re-resolve, per the mobile-submodule lockfile trap). Was imported in 7+ src files but only resolved via shamefully-hoist.
- ☐ **XL — Sidecar packaging** — bundle Node runtime + native deps (`better-sqlite3`, `node-pty`, `@vscode/ripgrep`, `typescript-language-server`, `pyright`), per-platform binaries, signing/notarization. *Schedule-killer risk — spike before GA.* (also tracked under Cross-cutting foundation.)
- ☐ **M — Capabilities / CSP** — least-privilege per-command trust boundary (`src-tauri/capabilities/`); shell plugin already dropped. Needed before GA.
- ☑ **L — Tauri bridge** (`lib/tauri/` + `src-tauri/commands/`) — showItemInFolder, readFile, showNotification, log, getPlatform done. Deferred: updates, AlertDialog shim, terminal PTY.

**Testing**
- ☐ **L — data-testid saturation + ADR stress matrix (chat build-order step 12)** — tag all interactive elements (chat + sessions) + run the stress matrix (long chat, nested subagent + mid-turn permission, reconnect, optimistic dedup, two windows).
- ◐ **XL — e2e harness + data-testids (Tauri story)** — **harness BUILT (2026-06-09):** browser-mode Playwright (Chromium vs `vite preview`, shared daemon fixture, `tauri` project, `helpers/tauri/`), 3 specs ported (composer 11/chat 8/sessions 9 passing). Remaining: port the other Electron-bound specs as their surfaces land.
- ☐ **L — Multi-window surface infrastructure** — two windows + cross-window state sync; a deferred acceptance criterion of the stress matrix, not yet designed.

**Layout / sidebar chrome** *(deferred from the built sessions sidebar)*
- ☑ **S — SessionSidebar group-header "more" popover** — DONE (was already built + tested; tracker was stale, 2026-06-08). `SessionsMoreMenu` = shadcn DropdownMenu → Archived sessions + Import external sessions, each opening its dialog (`ArchivedSessionsDialog`/`ImportSessionsDialog`); covered by `SessionsMoreMenu.test.tsx` + both dialog tests.
- ☐ **M — Ghosted/dashed "Add project" pill** (`ProjectFilterPillBar.tsx:10-11`) — dashed add-project button in the filter bar; inert without the add-project surface.
- ☐ **M — Add-project flow** (`features/sessions/` + `lib/api/projects.ts`) — directory picker + project create/register that makes the "Add project" pill live.
- ☐ **L — Surface rail (Chat / Files / Run vertical rail)** (`layout/` + `surfaces/{chat,files,run}/`) — gated on the Files/Run surfaces existing.
- ☐ **M — Bottom Context/Skills/Agents tabbed panel + resize handle** (`layout/` or `features/sessions/sidebar/`) — completes artboard parity below the session list.
- ◐ **M — Window chrome / traffic-lights + floating-panel** — traffic lights (`trafficLightPosition {x:20,y:30}`) + **floating panels** (`AppShell` `p-2 gap-2`) DONE (2026-06-08). *Remaining:* the warm-gradient **window background** behind the floating panels (today it's flat `bg-mf-window`, not the prototype's radial gradient).

**Layout engine / architecture**
- ☑ **XL — Typed-surface layout engine** (`src/layout/`) — SurfaceHost + SurfaceRail + SidebarHeader + SidebarShell + layout store (toggle+floor invariant) + FilesSurface/RunSurface stubs. Per-session remembered layout deferred.
- ☑ **M — Surface-intent bus** — emitSurfaceIntent/onSurfaceIntent; chat tool cards wired; no features→layout import.

**Shell**
- ☐ **L — Shell & global layout refactor** (`src/app/` + `src/shell/`) — main.tsx, App.tsx + global keybinds, TitleBar, StatusBar, ConnectionOverlay, ErrorBoundary, Toaster, Tutorial. Only App.tsx boot wiring exists today.

**Editor & viewers**
- ☐ **XL — Editor & viewers** (`features/editor/` + `features/viewers/`) — Monaco code+diff editors, `setup.ts` (workers/theme/opener), LSP client, copy-reference, inferLanguage/file-types, image/svg/pdf/csv viewers. Re-solve the Monaco loader story for Tauri.
- ☑ **S — Editor surface intents wired** (`features/chat/tools/chat-tool-context.ts`) — `useOpenFile()`/`revealFile` now emit `emitSurfaceIntent`; console.warn stubs removed.
- ☐ **M — Inline comments** (`features/editor/inline-comments/`) — `useInlineComments`/`InlineCommentWidget`; depends on the editor surface.
- ☐ **M — LSP-based navigation** (`features/editor/lsp/` + store) — replace regex `navigation.ts`; nav-state singletons → store.
- ☐ **S — Drop `LineCommentPopover`** (removal when editor lands).

**Terminal**
- ☐ **L — Rust PTY backend** (`src-tauri/terminal.rs`) — replaces Electron node-pty + IPC; foundational for the Run surface.
- ☐ **L — Terminal UI** (`features/terminal/` or `surfaces/run/terminal/`) — `TerminalInstance` (xterm) + `TerminalPanel` (tabs) + `terminal-cwd.ts` + `useTerminalStore`; drop tool-windows terminal registration.

**Settings**
- ☐ **M — Settings modal shell** (`features/settings/`) — shadcn Dialog-based chrome/sidebar/routing.
- ☐ **L — Settings store + Provider + panes** — TuningDefaults/CodexTuning/ModelDropdown + General/Notifications/About/Sidebar; decompose the 697-line `RemoteAccess` god-file (tunnel/pairing/devices).
- ☐ **M — Settings + remote-access API port** (`lib/api/settings.ts` + remote-access-api); drop the Keybindings placeholder pane.

**Overlays / review**
- ☐ **M — SearchPalette → shadcn Command** (`components/overlays/`) + retire the search store.
- ☐ **L — FindInPathModal + DirectoryPickerModal + ReviewPanel** (Header/DiffView/FileTree); drop `FullviewModal`.

**Sandbox / run**
- ☐ **L — Sandbox PreviewTab → embedded Tauri webview** (`features/preview/`) — inspect/capture/console; replaces the Electron `<webview>`. iframe-vs-webview-vs-window scope TBD.
- ☐ **L — Sandbox capture overlays + LaunchPopover/StopPopover + launch plumbing** (`features/run/`) + the capture-to-chat send path.

**Tasks / Git / Tags**
- ☐ **L — Tasks / Todos panels** (`features/tasks/`) — TodosPanel/TodoModal/QuickAdd/FilterBar/Card/Attachments/DependencyPicker + todos-api.
- ☐ **L — Git panels** (`features/git/`) — BranchPopover/List/Submenu/NewBranch/Conflict/Rename + useBranchActions.
- ☐ **M — Sandbox-side Tags** (`features/tags/`, run/sandbox tags) — distinct from the built **sessions** tags (Popover/Pill/store/api).

**Plugins**
- ☐ **XL — Plugins UI re-platform** (`features/plugins/`) — PluginView (779 lines), PluginIcon, PluginError, PluginGlobalComponents from Electron `<webview>` → Tauri webview + plugins store + plugins-api + usePluginShortcuts; drop the zone plugin bridge.

**State & data layer**
- ☐ **XL — State & data layer** (`src/stores/` + `src/hooks/` + `src/lib/`) — chats store + chat-actions + useChatSession + useActiveProjectId → controller; LSP client; domain stores (projects/adapters/settings/skills/tags/sandbox/terminal/background-tasks/theme/toasts/search/find-in-chat/tutorial/todos-filters) + pure helpers; replace tabs/plugins-layout stores; logger/notify/useUpdateStatus/global.d.ts → `lib/tauri`; drop layout/ui stores. *(WS client / useConnectionState / ws-event-router only partially landed — Phase 1.)*
- ☐ **M — UI primitives completion + bespoke helpers** (`components/ui/`) — replace Radix-wrapper primitives (button/tooltip/scroll-area) + context-menu + toggle with shadcn; build the missing (Dialog/Select/Dropdown/Popover/Command/Checkbox/Label); port scroll-row/truncated-label + `utils.cn()`; drop input.tsx/tabs.tsx/zone plugin bridge. *(18 primitives exist.)*

**Theming**
- ☐ **L — Theming / tokens refactor** (`src/styles/`) — `mainframe-theme.css` → Tailwind v4 `@theme`, 4 runtime-switchable themes, split Monaco/aui-md CSS out of `index.css`, eliminate the `/opacity`-on-CSS-var traps. *(◐ in progress; CSS split partly blocked on Monaco landing.)*

**Composer / config**
- ☐ **S — Provider-tuning-defaults not fetched** (`composer/config-toolbar/{EffortPicker.tsx:42,FeaturesPopover.tsx:56,use-composer-tuning.ts:19}`) — the 3rd arg to `displayEffort`/`effectiveFeature` is `undefined`; controls resolve model-effort/feature constraints without provider inheritance. Needs a settings/provider-defaults fetch.
- ☐ **S — Retry-resend wiring for failed user sends** (`messages/UserMessage.tsx:228-229` + controller) — "Failed to send" is visible but the retry action needs controller wiring that doesn't exist yet.
- ☐ **M — Sandbox captures in the user message** (`messages/UserMessage.tsx` UMContextRow + view-model parse) — the raw `\0__MF_SANDBOX_CAPTURE__` sentinel leaks as `MF_SANDBOX_CAPTURE` text; port desktop's `parseSandboxCaptureBlock` to strip it + render screenshot tiles + CSS-path inspect chips. (Capture-creation webview separately gated.)
- ☐ **M — Deferred user-message leaf states** (`messages/UserMessage.tsx:26,210-212`) — UMCodeRef (editor leaf), UMInspectChip (sandbox-capture leaf), PLAN "implementing plan" bubble (permission/plan leaf), FileAttachmentThumbs/UMContextRow chips (composer/attachments leaf). Plain markdown code blocks DO render.
- ☐ **M — WorktreePopover in composer** (`features/chat/composer/` + git/worktree API) — deferred pending verification whether it's REST-wireable like config.
- ☐ **S — Composer-drafts module Map → store** (`composer/composer-drafts.ts`) — no native draft persistence across chat switches today.
- ☐ **S — Broader rejection-toaster + native `attachmentAddError` wiring** (`composer/`) — >5MB rejection toasts now; the broader rejection UX + native event-driven wiring (vs adapter throw) are deferred.
- ☐ **M — Skills-registry subsystem** (`features/skills/` + `lib/api/skills.ts`) — full `/`-skills picker injection wiring beyond the resolved chip name + project-scoped skills state + API client; SkillsPanel out-of-band injection (`pendingInvocation`) has no app-tauri surface.

**Chat / messages / parts (deferred leaves)**
- ☐ **M — FindBar + QuoteOnSelection (find leaf) + full message parser** (`features/chat/find/` + view-model) — Cmd+F find + scroll-to-match, QuoteOnSelection (native SelectionToolbar/`MessagePrimitive.Quote` + CLI serialization glue). Inline mention highlight IS ported.
- ☐ **M — Small message-part renderers** (`features/chat/parts/`) — SandboxCaptureContext/SelectorBreadcrumb/ImageThumbs-gallery/FileTypeIcon/ErrorPart, deferred to their leaves.
- ☐ **S — ViewportFooter inset bug + Welcome/suggestions empty-state** (`thread/ChatThread.tsx`) — a real scroll-inset bug (tall PermissionCard overlaps the last message → move BottomCard into ViewportFooter) + the welcome screen + suggestion prompts.
- ☐ **S — Reasoning "Thought for Ns" duration** (`features/chat/messages` + daemon contract) — shows "Reasoning" until a daemon thinking-duration field exists; needs an additive daemon field.
- ☐ **M — Runtime-gated message actions** (`messages` MessageActionBar) — Reload/Edit-sent/BranchPicker/Feedback/Speak; CLI-resume has no branches/edit and the rest need daemon endpoints. Ships Copy + Export only; don't render disabled buttons.
- ☐ **S — Multi-image gallery lightbox** (`features/chat/parts`, ImageLightbox keep-ours) — prev/next nav shared by SessionAttachmentsGrid + todos modals; single-image zoom IS restored (`ZoomableImage`).

**Chat / sessions runtime**
- ☐ **M — Migrate deprecated assistant-ui hooks → `useAui`/`useAuiState` selectors** (`sessions/sidebar/{SessionSidebar,SessionRow}.tsx`, `sessions/tags/TagPopoverHost.tsx`, `sessions/ws/use-session-list-router.ts`, any chat sites) — `useThreadListRuntime` isn't publicly exported (sessions use `useAssistantRuntime().threads` as the workaround); several deprecated-path hooks (`useAssistantRuntime`/`useThreadListItemRuntime`/`useThreadRuntime`/`useMessageRuntime`) are in active use.
- ☐ **M — Restored-permission "stream closed" known gap** (`features/chat/runtime` + daemon restore path) — replying to a restored permission whose CLI died (daemon restart between Q and A) fails with "stream closed"; self-recovers on reload; plain reconnect with the CLI alive works. *Logged, not fixed.*
- ☐ **S — Toast/badge surfacing of `queued.cancel_failed`** (`controller/chat-thread-state.ts:91`) — explicit no-op in the reducer (prevents silent fallthrough); a global `toast.error` already fires via `routeDaemonEvent`, richer per-event UX deferred.

**Architecture / open decisions**
- ☐ **M — Shared pure-logic package home** (`@qlan-ro/mainframe-types` vs new `@qlan-ro/mainframe-shared`) — where `convertMessage` + diff math + file-types + `model-tuning` live so desktop & app-tauri share one copy. Currently app-tauri-local/duplicated.
- ☐ **S — Model-tuning dedup to a bundleable location** (`lib/model-tuning.ts:10`, TODO(dedup)) — tied to the shared-package decision.
- ☐ **S — Permission-card mount placement decision** (`features/chat/gates`) — inline-at-tail (default) vs inline-under-tool; the latter needs the daemon `control_request` to carry the originating `tool_use` id.
- ☐ **XL — Phase-2 Rust daemon go/no-go + sizing** (`src-tauri/` daemon) — biggest unscoped workstream; decide before committing (affects terminal/sidecar).
- ☐ **M — Electron app lifecycle — retire vs coexist** — parallel-maintenance tax + dual-instance contention over one data dir + fixed port; defines parity DoD.
- ☐ **S — Mobile-contract governance rule** — the WS/REST contract is co-owned by the mobile submodule; establish an explicit additive-only governance rule.
