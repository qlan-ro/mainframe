## 2.0.0-rc.7

### Minor Changes

- [#458](https://github.com/qlan-ro/mainframe/pull/458) [`41c87af`](https://github.com/qlan-ro/mainframe/commit/41c87af258415f88863a72df4a49b5ebfb045866) Thanks [@doruchiulan](https://github.com/doruchiulan)! - Add an update channel setting (Stable / Pre-release) in Settings → General. Electron respects it via `electron-updater`'s `allowPrerelease`; Tauri resolves the newest published GitHub release directly for the pre-release channel, since its updater has no built-in concept of channels.
